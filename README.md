## Variables (Env) üîó
In this project, variables are utilized to enhance security, facilitate project sharing, enable deployment, among other functionalities. Listed below are the .env variables employed, predominantly sourced from Webflow and Firebase:

```bash
# Firebase
NEXT_PUBLIC_FB_API_KEY="..."
NEXT_PUBLIC_FB_AUTH_DOMAIN="..."
NEXT_PUBLIC_FB_PROJECT_ID="..."
NEXT_PUBLIC_FB_STORAGE_BUCKET="..."
NEXT_PUBLIC_FB_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="..."
NEXT_PUBLIC_FB_APP_ID="..."

# Webflow 
NEXT_PUBLIC_WF_SITE_ENDPOINT="..."
NEXT_PUBLIC_WF_AUTH_TOKEN="..."
NEXT_PUBLIC_WF_SITE_ID="..."
```

## Firebase üî•
In this project, Firebase Auth is utilized to configure authentication for users via DevLink. Below are the steps to create a project, the necessary requirements, and the procedure to retrieve environmental variables:

1. Initialize a Firebase Project
2. Activate Firebase Authentication
3. Configure Authorized Domains
4. Within the same Firebase project, establish a Web App
5. Transfer variables to the pre-configured .env file

## Webflow üñäÔ∏è
Here is the list on how to setup the project and variables:

1. If you haven't already, sign up for a devlink at https://webflow.com/devlink. Fill in the form, and you should gain immediate access using the email you registered with
2. Next, visit {{link}} and clone our free template
3. Navigate to 'Site Settings' and then to 'Apps & Integrations'. In the 'API access' section, generate an API token. Save this token to your .env file.
3. Return to the dashboard and select 'Components'. There, you'll find a "Export components" button. Click on it to reveal a .json file. Extract the siteId variable from this file and add it to your environment variables.
4. If you haven't installed it yet, run npm i `@webflow/webflow-cli -g` to get the Webflow CLI.
